## Harsimar Sahota – Assignment 3 Contribution

###  Transaction (a): Internet Bill – Not Yet Paid
- Dr: Internet Expense 80.00
- Cr: Accounts Payable 80.00

**Explanation**: The internet provider has billed us, which is an expense. But we haven’t paid yet, so we increase Accounts Payable. This keeps the accounting equation balanced.

###  Transaction (b): Payroll Liability – Not Yet Paid
- Dr: Payroll Expense 2,125.00
- Cr: Payroll Liability 2,125.00

**Explanation**: We know the payroll is due soon. So we record it as a liability. This records the cost (Payroll Expense) and shows we owe money (Payroll Liability).

###  Notes
